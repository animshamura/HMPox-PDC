# **Bioinformatics & Deep Learning for Mpox Virus Diagnosis & Treatment**

## **Overview**
Mpox is rapidly spreading globally, and timely, accurate diagnosis is critical. Traditional diagnostic methods like PCR are slow and costly, often inaccessible in resource-limited settings. Deep learning and bioinformatics offer innovative solutions, enabling faster, more reliable diagnoses and personalized treatment options. This research focuses on enhancing Mpox management through AI, leveraging both imaging and genetic data.

## **Objectives**
- **Boost Diagnostic Accuracy**: Improve Mpox detection using deep learning models.
- **Early Prognosis**: Predict disease progression and severity for better patient care.
- **Support Clinical Decisions**: Combine AI and bioinformatics for tailored treatment suggestions.
- **Overcome Data Limitations**: Use synthetic data and transfer learning to address small datasets.
- **Enhance Genomic Understanding**: Study virus mutations for more effective outbreak control.

## **Literature Insights**

### **1. Monkey Pox Diagnosis with Interpretable Deep Learning**
- **Method**: Uses pre-trained models (e.g., VGG19, MobileNetV2) with LIME for interpretability.
- **Limitations**: Small datasets, generalization issues, and lack of clinical validation.
- **Improvements**: Expand datasets, integrate imaging and genomic data, and optimize for mobile deployment.

### **2. PoxNet22: Transfer Learning for Monkeypox Classification**
- **Method**: Fine-tuned InceptionV3 model with data augmentation.
- **Limitations**: Limited data, binary classification, and transfer learning dependence.
- **Improvements**: Add multi-class classification, validate in clinical settings, and explore ensemble models.

### **3. CNN for Mpox Skin Lesions Classification**
- **Method**: Uses CNN and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) for model optimization.
- **Limitations**: Data scarcity, overfitting, and lack of explainability.
- **Improvements**: Expand datasets, implement explainable AI (Grad-CAM), and optimize for mobile devices.

### **4. MPXV-CNN for Mpox Lesion Classification**
- **Method**: Deep CNN with high sensitivity and specificity for Mpox lesions.
- **Limitations**: Dataset biases, skin tone underrepresentation, and performance degradation with low-quality images.
- **Improvements**: Expand datasets, refine the model for diverse skin tones, and integrate with national outbreak systems.

## **Proposed Solutions**
- **Multi-modal Diagnostics**: Combine lesion images with genomic data for enhanced accuracy.
- **Federated Learning**: Train models across multiple institutions while maintaining privacy.
- **Synthetic Data**: Use GANs to generate diverse lesion images, addressing data scarcity.
- **Explainable AI**: Implement tools like Grad-CAM and SHAP for transparency in clinical decision-making.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Develop models to distinguish Mpox from other diseases like chickenpox and herpes.
